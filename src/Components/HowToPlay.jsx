              The game is simple and fun! Your objective is to collect a
              specific number of fruits in each level â€” but watch out for
              Monkey-Boo! As you advance, the number of fruits required
              increases, and Monkey-Boo changes positions to keep you on your
              toes. Each type of fruit carries a different point value, so
              choose wisely and move quickly!

            <p className="">
              This game is my personal project, I started this with one goal in
              mind - TO LEARN. I have faced several challenges in terms of
              logic, brainstorming and design, so I used every available
              resource and everything that I have learned so far, in order to
              achieve a certain feature and to debug. Currently This work, like
              any other work, consumed a serious amount of time and energy. But
              I've dedicated my whole heart in creating this, enough I think
              that I call it a masterpiece.
